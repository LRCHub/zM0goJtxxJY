[00:30.66] Help, something's wrong with me
[00:41.02] Homesick for LA
[00:46.95] In the summer of my life
[00:55.43] That's when we first met
[01:00.92] Through a friend
[01:05.94] Something about you makes me feel like I can
[01:13.51] Is it a dream or is it all in the past?
[01:20.30] I just thought I'd ask
[01:31.30] 
[01:26.61] So I turn back the time
[01:31.42] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[01:41.63] I turn back the time
[01:45.29] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright

[02:51.60] So I turn back the time
[02:56.69] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[03:06.76] I turn back the time
[03:10.84] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[03:29.34] 
[03:21.19] I turn back the time
[03:25.19] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[03:35.33] I turn back the time
[03:39.30] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[03:57.80] 
[03:48.96] So I turn back the time
[03:53.79] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[04:02.97] So I turn back the time
[04:07.79] I'm at the chateau and I feel alright
[04:26.29] 
[04:17.75] So I turn back the time
[04:22.70] I'm at the chateau and I feel-
